## Testing Notes

How do we prevent bugs?

1. Static Types: Flow / Typescript
2. Linting: ESLint
3. Testing: ??

What kind of testing can we do?
Lots~

#### Unit Test?
Tests a small bit of code. Does this small piece of functionality work?

#### Integration Test?
Testing many units together. Does the component integrate in the system

#### End to End Test?

Can a user accomplish an action?  Testing a whole flow in your application.  Focus on the flows that could cause problems. 


Where do you we focus our time?

Unit -> Integration -> E2E

Unit are cheaper and easier.
